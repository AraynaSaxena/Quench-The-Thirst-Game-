Abstract of the project:

‘Quench the thirst’ is a web-based game meant to educate children and youth about the water crisis and water poverty worldwide. The story and game guides you through a simulation of Chiru’s arduous struggles to find water each and every day. The player navigates obstacles like tumbleweeds and birds by jumping and ducking over them as they block their way. Every time an obstacle hits the player, water is lost -emulating the difficult landscape Chiru faces bringing water home to her family. The only way to succeed is to arrive home without having lost all of the water. The amount of water the player begins with is randomly generated (but reflects real circumstances), and the background also changes colour based on the time of day.

Objectives
The objectives are:
The main objective of the save water campaign is to increase awareness of consumers about the scarcity of clean water. We aim to reduce consumer everyday water usage rate due to the water crisis in Malaysia. We hope that through the campaign, consumers can learn how to save water and use the water wisely.
As games are more influencing on the people now a days we came up with a game which explains us the scarcity of water and helps us understand the importance of water.
We aim to target all levels of consumer including children, students and the whole family. We would educate consumers about the importance of safe water and the seriousness of scarcity of clean water supply. We must think for the next generation, therefore saving water starts from now
